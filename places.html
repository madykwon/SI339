		<h1>COPENHAGEN</h1>
		<h2>a travel diary</h2><!-- image: me.jpg-->

Nyhavn - The place that, if you're familiar with Copenhagen, will most likely pop up first in your mind (the iconic strip of colorful buildings along the canal). Visit during the day and at night to get the full experience.

Amager Strand - There are a plethora of beaches just outside of the city center that are easy to get to by car, train, or bus. This particular beach I visited was called Amager Strand (strand meaning beach). But take note before planning a trip to the beach, that even in the summer you have to carefully choose a day when the weather is warm enough to swim, because you never know when an unexpected chilly day will hit. My friends and I went on a day that started out warm, but it started raining when we got to the beach :(

Refshaleøen - An old industrial shipyard area that is now home to a Mikkeller beer garden, an outdoor food market in the summer, and a stunning waterfront. One of my favorite spots that I visited!

Rundetaarn (Round Tower) - Surprisingly one of the tallest buildings in Copenhagen (if you are from any large city you will understand why that is surprising). Walk up the winding ramp to see a pretty cool view of Copenhagen from above.

Canal Tour - This is one the touristy things that is actually worth paying for. Bring some snacks along with you and enjoy a serene boat tour of Copenhagen's most famous sites.

Street trampolines - A quintessentially Danish idea: something fun + unique built into the infrastructure of the city that's completely open to the public.
