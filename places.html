<h1>PLACES</h1>

<div class="bold">Nyhavn</div>
<p>The place that, if you're familiar with Copenhagen, will most likely pop up first in your mind (the iconic strip of colorful buildings along the canal). There's bound to be a ton of tourists around the area at all times, but it's worth seeing the iconic scene. Make sure to visit Nyhavn during the day AND at night to get the full experience.</p>

<div class="bold">Amager Strand</div> 
<p>There is a plethora of beaches just outside of the city center that are easy to get to by car, train, or bus. This particular beach I visited was called Amager Strand (strand meaning beach). Take note if you are planning on making the trip to the beach that even in the summer there are random chilly/rainy days when the temperature won't be warm enough to swim. My friends and I went on a day that started out warm, but later turned rainy when we got to the beach :(</p>

<div class="bold">Refshaleøen</div>
<p>An old industrial shipyard area that is now home to a <a href="http://mikkeller.dk/location/mikkeller-baghaven/" target="_blank">Mikkeller beer garden</a> with unique flavors of beer on tap, an outdoor food market in the summer with foods from all over the world, and a stunning waterfront. This was one of my favorite spots I visited, so my friend and I ended up staying there all day.</p>

<div class="bold">Rundetaarn (Round Tower)</div> 
<p>Surprisingly one of the tallest buildings in Copenhagen (if you are from any large city you will understand why that is surprising). Although you can't compare it to the view from Griffith Observatory in LA or the Empire State building in New York City, the view from the top of the <a href="https://www.visitcopenhagen.com/copenhagen/round-tower-gdk410741" target="_blank">Round Tower</a> gives you a solid view of the city. I was most impressed by the winding path leading up to the top, because it was a sloped ramp instead of stairs.</p>

<div class="bold">Canal Tour</div>
<p>This is one touristy activity that is actually worth paying for. The boat takes you around all of the canals and allows you to see most of the major sites (like <a href="https://www.visitcopenhagen.com/copenhagen/little-mermaid-gdk586951" target="_blank">The Little Mermaid</a>). Bring some snacks along with you and hope that it's a sunny day!</p>

<div class="bold">Street trampolines</div>
<p>A quintessentially Danish idea: something fun & unique built into the infrastructure of the city that's completely free and open to the public.</p>

<div class="bold">Assistens Cemetery</div>
<p>I randomly walked through this cemetery thinking it was a park, and I'm so glad I did because it was stunning. The rows of trees and the shadows they created were so beautiful. It's located in the vibrant, urban neighborhood of <a href="https://www.visitcopenhagen.com/copenhagen/6-ways-to-do-norrebro" target="_blank">Nørrebrø</a>, so if you visit take time to explore the surrounding streets and shops too.</p>

<div class="bold">Black Diamond Library</div>
<p>A unique building set apart by its glass walls and view of the water. It's a great place to study, read or just enjoy the sunlight shining in.</p>
