If you look up any Copenhagen travel guides or anything about Denmark, I almost guarantee you will find something about “hygge”. 
</p>
<div>
	Hygge is a Danish term that translates into ‘cozy’, ‘warm’, or more conceptually, a state of well-being that results from a Danish lifestyle – which entails spending weekends relaxing with family, spending as much time outside as possible, biking everywhere, drinking casually with friends, having picnics, swimming in the canals, and chatting at cafés.

Danes are strict about separating work and leisure, and have mastered a very well-balanced work/rest lifestyle. They work hard while at work and make sure to enjoy life at all other times. And no matter what they're doing, they look fashionable doing it. Both foreigners and Danes themselves attribute Denmark’s ranking in the top three happiest countries in the world to the distinctive Danish lifestyle. So evidently, we have a lot to learn from the Danes.
